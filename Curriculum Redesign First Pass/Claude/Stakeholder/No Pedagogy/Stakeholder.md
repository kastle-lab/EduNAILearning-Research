Based on the provided module structural data, I've redesigned an educational curriculum and learning path specifically for the Stakeholder persona. This revised design focuses on providing a high-level overview of key concepts and technologies related to knowledge graphs, without delving too deeply into technical details. The learning path is organized to flow logically, starting with foundational concepts and progressing to more advanced topics that are relevant to decision-makers.

Here's the revised design in the same structural format:

```

This revised curriculum is designed to provide Stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of knowledge graphs, their business value, implementation strategies, and future trends. The learning path progresses from foundational concepts to more advanced topics, focusing on aspects that are most relevant to decision-makers and business leaders. Each module builds upon the previous ones, ensuring a logical flow of information and a gradual increase in complexity.
