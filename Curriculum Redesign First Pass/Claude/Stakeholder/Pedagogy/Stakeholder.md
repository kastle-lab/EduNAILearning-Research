Based on the provided module structural data, I've redesigned an educational curriculum and learning path for the Stakeholder persona, incorporating Spaced Retrieval and Interleaving pedagogical frameworks. The revised design focuses on providing a high-level overview of key concepts, their business implications, and potential benefits, suitable for stakeholders who need to understand the fundamentals without delving too deep into technical details.

Here's the revised design in the same structural format:

This redesigned curriculum for stakeholders focuses on providing a high-level understanding of knowledge graphs and their business implications. The learning path is structured to build upon previous concepts while incorporating spaced retrieval and interleaving:

1. The curriculum starts with an introduction to basic concepts, followed by their business value to immediately engage stakeholders.

2. It then alternates between foundational concepts, implementation strategies, and practical applications to maintain interest and demonstrate real-world relevance.

3. More advanced topics like data governance and technology evaluation are introduced later, building on the foundational knowledge.

4. The curriculum concludes with project planning and future trends, providing a forward-looking perspective.

To incorporate spaced retrieval and interleaving:

1. Each module should include brief reviews of concepts from previous modules to reinforce learning.

2. Practical examples and case studies should be used throughout to illustrate how different concepts interrelate.

3. Quizzes or discussion sessions should be interspersed between modules to encourage active recall.

4. The "Knowledge Graph Applications in Industry" module serves as a comprehensive review, tying together previous concepts in real-world contexts.

5. The final "Future Trends" module encourages stakeholders to apply their learned knowledge to potential future scenarios.

This structure ensures a logical flow of information while maintaining engagement and encouraging long-term retention of key concepts relevant to stakeholders.
