Designing an educational curriculum specifically for a Designer audience in the context of knowledge graphs requires a structured approach that incorporates both Spaced Retrieval and Interleaving pedagogical frameworks. This enhanced curriculum aims to foster deep understanding and long-term retention through logical flow and deliberate interweaving of new and old concepts. The curriculum is modular, allowing Designers to follow a path that builds on foundational knowledge before exploring advanced topics.

### Curriculum Design Explanation

1. **Spaced Retrieval**: The modules revisit key concepts like RDF/RDFS, OWL, and rules across different contexts throughout the curriculum, enhancing retention and understanding.

2. **Interleaving**: By mixing foundational theory with practical application modules (e.g., "Logical Foundations" before "RDF and RDFS"), designers can apply their expanding knowledge in varied contexts, promoting creative problem-solving skills.

3. **Logical Flow**: The design moves logically from essential fundamental knowledge to advanced application and integration, preparing designers to effectively build, analyze, and deploy knowledge graphs.

This curriculum ensures that designers are not only able to understand the theoretical underpinnings of knowledge graphs but can also apply them in real-world scenarios, leveraging best practices in knowledge engineering and schema design.
