To design an educational curriculum and learning path for the Stakeholder persona, we need to focus on providing a high-level understanding of knowledge graphs, emphasizing comprehensive coverage of fundamental concepts, without delving too deeply into technical implementation details. Given the pedagogical frameworks of Spaced Retrieval and Interleaving, we'll ensure that topics are revisited regularly in different contexts to reinforce learning, and that a mix of topics is varied to promote better retention and understanding.

Below is the redesigned curriculum for the Stakeholder audience:

### Explanation:

1. **Spaced Retrieval** is applied by introducing foundational concepts early and revisiting them through more complex modules later, ensuring reinforcement and long-term retention.

2. **Interleaving** is incorporated by mixing modules on history, foundational concepts, technologies, methodologies, and practical applications, helping stakeholders see the broader context and applications of knowledge graphs.

3. **Flow**: The curriculum progresses logically from basic terminology and history (e.g., Metadata, Ontologies, Knowledge Graphs) to intermediate applications (e.g., Introduction to Knowledge Engineering, Deploying a Knowledge Graph), ensuring that stakeholders have a holistic understanding without overwhelming technical detail.

This design ensures Stakeholders can grasp the overall importance, implications, and applications of knowledge graphs, leveraging these insights to inform strategic decisions and organizational planning.
