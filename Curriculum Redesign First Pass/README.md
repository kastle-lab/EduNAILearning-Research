# Curriculum Redesign First Pass

## Observations

- With Pedagogy, GPT and Mistral structured the learning path by organizing existing curriculum modules. They introduced prerequisite modules (e.g., "prev" and "next") while ensuring some topics revisited broader ancestor concepts. Modules were ordered to introduce new topics that connect back to previously completed modules.
- Claude generated entirely new curricula, learning paths, and module lists tailored to each persona. It also defined topics for each module, employing a similar repetition style.
- Claude's approach involved creating from scratch, while GPT and Mistral refined the existing structure.
